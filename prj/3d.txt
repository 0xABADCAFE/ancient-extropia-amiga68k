Half a bee, philisophically, must ipso facto half not be.
But half the bee has got to be a viz a viz its entity. You see ?
But can a bee be said to be, or not to be an entire be,
when half the bee is not a bee, due to some ancient injury ?

Singing

A-La dee dee, a one two three,
Eric the half a bee
A B C D E F G
Eric the half a bee

Is this wretched demi bee,
a half asleep upon my knee,
some freak from a menagerie ? No!
Its Eric the half a bee

A-fiddle-de-dum, a-fiddle-de-dee
Eric the half a bee,
Ho ho ho, tee hee hee,
Eric the half a bee

I love this hive employee-ee,
biscected accidentally
one summer afternoon by me,
I love him carnally,
He loves him carnally,
Semi carnally

The End.

Cyril Conelly ?

No, semi carnally...

oh..
